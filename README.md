# androidapp-SMS
I have created  an Android application with two buttons that send out two different SMS messages when clicked. One button is labeled “SMS1” and the other is labeled “SMS2.” The first button  send the message “Hello, you are you today?” I can use any phone number to send the message to. The second button  invoke the device SMS application.
